    <p>Hi, my name is Jim and welcome to my HTML-only page. I always believe that in learning, theory should always be put to the test so that knowledge can be retained easily in our brain. That is why, whether it's HTML or JavaScript, no matter how simple the code is, it should be tested through a project.</p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to test your knowledge on basic HTML.</p> <hr>

    <h3>What I pursue?</h3>
    <p>It has always been my dream to be a successful web developer and at the same time to be a successful educator.</p>
